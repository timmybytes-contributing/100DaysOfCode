### Day 1: Saturday June 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started on a personal website project, so far just a simple landing page.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ideas for things to implement, but I often
get into a googling-tangent spiral, trying to understand how to do
things the right way (or at least, not the complete wrong way).

### Day 2: Sunday June 28th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Made more progress with layout and how elements interact together on the page. Practiced more Codecademy exercises.

**Thoughts:** Getting elements to stay where you want them, especially in relation to responsive design, is a bigger pain than I thought.

**Link(s) to work:** No new commits today; WIP.


### Day 3: Monday June 29th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** More Codecademy practice, discovered [Jen Simmons'](https://labs.jensimmons.com/) hugely inspirational design work and explanations on css grid.

**Thoughts:** Getting a better understanding on how elements can be manipulated to work within an overall design scheme.

**Link(s) to work:** No new commits today; WIP.


### Day 4: Monday June 29th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Completed (most) of a recreation of Google.com from pure HTML/CSS with working search redirection.

**Thoughts:** Trying to juggle flexbox and style parameters requires more systematic selectors on my part, as the code is a bit of a mess.
