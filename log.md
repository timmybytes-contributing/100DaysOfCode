**Link(s) to work:**
Nothing yet!

### Day 1: Saturday June 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started on a personal website project, so far just a simple landing page.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ideas for things to implement, but I often
get into a googling-tangent spiral, trying to understand how to do
things the right way (or at least, not the complete wrong way).

**Link(s) to work:** [timmybytes.com](timmybytes.com) (SSL pending via GitHub).


### Day 2: Sunday June 28th, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Made more progress with layout and how elements interact together on the page. Practiced more Codecademy exercises.

**Thoughts:** Getting elements to stay where you want them, especially in relation to responsive design, is a bigger pain than I thought.

**Link(s) to work:** No new commits today; WIP.
