### Day 0: Friday June 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Setting up environments and planning projects. Forked '100DaysOfCode' repo.

**Thoughts:**

Nothing yet!

### Day 1: Saturday June 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started on a personal website project, so far just a simple landing page.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ideas for things to implement, but I often
get into a googling-tangent spiral, trying to understand how to do
things the right way (or at least, not the complete wrong way).

**Link(s) to work:** [timmybytes.com](timmybytes.com) (SSL pending via GitHub).


### Day 2: Sunday June 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Made more progress with layout and how elements interact together on the page. Practiced more Codecademy exercises.

**Thoughts:** Getting elements to stay where you want them, especially in relation to responsive design, is a bigger pain than I thought.

**Link(s) to work:** No new commits today; WIP.


### Day 3: Monday June 29th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More Codecademy practice, discovered [Jen Simmons'](https://labs.jensimmons.com/) hugely inspirational design work and explanations on css grid.

**Thoughts:** Getting a better understanding on how elements can be manipulated to work within an overall design scheme.

**Link(s) to work:** No new commits today; WIP.


### Day 4: Tuesday June 30th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed (most) of a recreation of Google.com from pure HTML/CSS with working search redirection.

**Thoughts:** Trying to juggle flexbox and style parameters requires more systematic selectors on my part, as the code is a bit of a mess.

**Link(s) to work:** [Google Homepage Copy](https://github.com/timmybytes/WebDevPractice/tree/master/Google_Homepage_Copy)


### Day 5: Wednesday July 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learned the basics of SASS and how it can be used to both streamline and add greater complexity to web design.

**Thoughts:** SASS seems to add more functional-type programming to the typically more 'static' side of HTML/CSS. I'm looking forward to using it.

**Link(s) to work:** No projects today.


### Day 6: Thursday July 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Less time to code today. Spent some time experimenting with SASS and creating mixins and variables to better separate my code without repeating. Played with Figma to try out styling/layout options.

**Thoughts:** I am tired, that's my only thought.

**Link(s) to work:** No projects today.


### Day 7: Friday July 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Exercises on Codecademy, lots of reading and compiling of a roadmap doc to help guide my learning. About to spend some time hacking at my site before I turn in.

**Thoughts:** There are so many things to learn for WebDev, but I can see a linear pathway through how to get there.

**Link(s) to work:** No projects today.


### Day 8: Saturday July 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Ill today, not much work done. Studied up on color-blind-friendly palettes and type scale ratios. Got my nav bar working for a site not done yet!

**Thoughts:** Accessibility is an easily overlooked aspect in design, but should always be a part of *how* you design.

**Link(s) to work:** No projects today.


### Day 9: Sunday July 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Built a new basic site with flexbox to get a better handle on how it interact with layout elements. Finding a decent design balance. Read up on contributing to open source projects, but still a bit overwhelmed on what to look for and how to help.

**Thoughts:** The layers of the code onion are damn near endless.

**Link(s) to work:** [Not yet live, but code is here](https://github.com/timmybytes/WebDevPractice/tree/master/flexbox_test)


### Day 10: Monday July 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked more on flex-based site, toying with SASS and responsiveness now... lost in the cascade. Found some great new sites and podcasts to check out. CSSInRealLife and A Question of Code

**Thoughts:** I think I'm kind of over the "thoughts" portion of the log? These will just be mixed in with the day's progress from now on.

### Day 11: Tuesday July 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished most of the layout for the site and it's now live. Still have some tweaking to do, and then all of the non-coding editing to do to get content ready for publishing.

### Day 12: Wednesday July 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Little time to work today. Mostly tweaked a few settings to simplify/tone-down some of the design of the site. I need to start working on other projects too or I'm going to get totally consumed with this thing.

**Link(s) to work:** https://timmybytes.com


### Day 13: Thursday July 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through a tutorial on SASS via [codeSTACKr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) to build a mock developer portfolio site. Spent some time tinkering with Python again, looking to make a web scraper of some kind on the side of learning the front end.

**Link(s) to work:** [DevPortfolioSite](https://github.com/timmybytes/WebDevPractice/tree/master/DevProfileSite)


### Day 14: Friday July 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started learning JavaScript more in-depth today, far more similarities with Python than I originally thought. Still dabbling with a Python script to use in an old project I never finished (the one that got me into coding in the first place).

**Link(s) to work:** N/A


### Day 15: Saturday July 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started building a site with css grid today, and playing with color schemes.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A


### Day 16: Sunday July 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Working on basic grid layout and hierarchy.

### Day 17: Monday July 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Not as much progress today, since it was the first day of vacation. Still added some things to the basic landing page.

### Day 18: Tuesday July 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Reading [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/), which has been hugely helpful. I get so hung up on the design parts of development, and these guys offer a great set of boundaries to work within. Did some more JavaScript practice problems on Codecademy.

**Link(s) to work:** No links; working on creating a repeatable system for continued use in projects.


### Day 19: Wednesday July 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Reading [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/), SASS mixins created to adhere to a design system for a webdev template.

**Link(s) to work:** No links; working on creating a repeatable system for continued use in projects.


### Day 20: Thursday July 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Reading [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/), JS practice and learning exercises, DOM.

**Link(s) to work:** No links; working on creating a repeatable system for continued use in projects.


### Day 21: Friday July 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Light day. More tinkering with SASS and HTML, and creating mockups in Figma before building a new layout (this helped a ton). Going to dip my toe in JS to try and get some interactive navigation working.

### Day 22: Saturday July 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completely rebuilt my website, and I'm finally starting to be happy with the cohesion of layout and design. Now to add a blog...
